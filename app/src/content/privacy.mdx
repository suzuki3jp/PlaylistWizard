This Privacy Policy explains how PlaylistWizard ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects personal data when you use our web application ("App").

## Data We Collect

When you use the App, we collect and store the following categories of data:

- **Profile information**: Information obtained from your OAuth provider, such as your name, email address, and profile image.
- **Authentication information**: OAuth tokens required to access YouTube and Spotify services on your behalf.
- **Session information**: Technical information necessary for managing your login state, such as your IP address and browser information.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as it is necessary to provide the App's services. Session data is deleted when you sign out. Account information and authentication tokens are retained until you delete your account.

## Security of Data

We take your privacy seriously. While we use commercially acceptable methods to protect your data, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Disclosures of Data

We store authentication data necessary to access Google and Spotify services on your behalf, but we do not store your playlist content data (such as video titles, track names, or album art). We do not sell or disclose any information to third parties, except in response to formal legal procedures.

## Cookies

The App uses the following types of cookies:

- **Session cookies**: Used to manage your login state and authenticate your requests.
- **Language preference**: Used to remember your preferred language setting.
- **UI preference**: Used to remember your UI settings, such as sidebar state.
- **Analytics cookies**: Used by Google Analytics to understand usage patterns. See the "Use of Google Analytics" section below for details.

You can disable cookies through your browser settings. However, disabling cookies may affect the functionality of the App.

## Use of Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to understand usage patterns of the App. This includes:

- Pages visited
- Time spent
- Referring sites

Google Analytics collects only your IP address (used on the day of your visit), which is anonymized and not combined with personally identifiable information. A persistent cookie may be used to distinguish you as a returning user. You may disable cookies in your browser to prevent this tracking.

Google's usage and sharing of this data is governed by the:

- [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated policy becomes effective upon posting.
