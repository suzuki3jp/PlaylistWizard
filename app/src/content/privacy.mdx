This Privacy Policy explains how PlaylistWizard ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects personal data when you use our web application ("App").

## Security of Data

We take your privacy seriously. While we use commercially acceptable methods to protect your data, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Disclosures of Data

We do not store your Google or Spotify data. We do not sell or disclose any information to third parties, except in response to formal legal procedures.

## Use of Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to understand usage patterns of the App. This includes:

- Pages visited
- Time spent
- Referring sites

Google Analytics collects only your IP address (used on the day of your visit), which is anonymized and not combined with personally identifiable information. A persistent cookie may be used to distinguish you as a returning user. You may disable cookies in your browser to prevent this tracking.

Google's usage and sharing of this data is governed by the:

- [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)
