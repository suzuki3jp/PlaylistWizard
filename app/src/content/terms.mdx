If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use the App.

## 3. Limitation of Liability

The App is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

We are not liable for any damages, losses, or consequences resulting from the use of the App, including but not limited to service interruptions, errors, or data loss. Use of the App is entirely at your own risk.

## 6. Music Service APIs

The App uses the YouTube Data API v3 to manage your playlists. It is not affiliated with YouTube or Google. To provide this functionality, we store authentication tokens required to access the YouTube API on our servers.

Operations such as adding, deleting, and updating playlists are executed via the YouTube API to enable playlist management.

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the App at any time without notice. We may update these Terms from time to time. Updates become effective upon posting.
